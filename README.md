# Bayesian RetinaNet
This is the repo of Bayesian RetinaNet, namely it implements Bayesian Focal Loss and Bayesian Smooth L1 Loss for the task of pollen images recognition.

 
First it was proposed for the COCO dataset. See the PyTorch implementation here https://github.com/aleksej-lapenok/detectron2/blob/smooth_l1_v2/detectron2/modeling/meta_arch/retinanet.py.

See the paper here http://bayesiandeeplearning.org/2021/papers/69.pdf.
 
The RetinaNet code is based on https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet. Readme will be updated later.
